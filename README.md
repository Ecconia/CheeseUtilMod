# Cheese Util Mod
## Installation
Clone the repository, and copy the ```cheeseutil``` folder into ```<logicworld>/GameData```
## Memory
This mod adds multiple memory components, they have the address lines on top, and the data on bottom
The least significant bit is to the left side when looking at the inputs
On top of the RAM components are a chip select and write line from left to write looking at the input side
And on the back is the data out, with each bit being in the same position as the data in
